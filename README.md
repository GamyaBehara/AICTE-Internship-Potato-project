<h1>🍂 Potato Leaf Disease Classification</h1> 
This project uses deep learning and image processing to classify potato leaf diseases into Late Blight and Early Blight. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a labeled dataset of leaf images to automate disease detection. The system scans the leaf for pores, texture, and health before processing the image for classification

🔹 Key Features:
● AI-based image classification using CNNs
● Preprocessing (resizing, normalization, and augmentation)
● Binary classification (Late Blight & Early Blight)
● Potential for real-time deployment via web or mobile apps
