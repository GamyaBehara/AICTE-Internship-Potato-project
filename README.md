🍂 Potato Leaf Disease Classification
<h1>
  This project uses deep learning and image processing to classify potato leaf diseases into Late Blight and Early Blight. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a labeled dataset of leaf images to automate disease detection. The system scans the leaf for pores, texture, and health before processing the image for classification
